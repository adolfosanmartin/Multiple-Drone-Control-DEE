**Multiple drone control in the Drone Engineering Ecosystem**

The main goal of this project was to develop a desktop application using Python and CustomTkinter which makes possible to fly up to four drones at the same time inside the DroneLab in the EETAC (UPC) campus . This application allows the user to:
  - Visualize up to four drones in the main panel.
  - Configuration of the geofence and its parameters for each drone.
  - Return To Launch maneuver for each drone from the main panel.
  - Secondarily it allows to pilot each drone from the app.
