**<h1>Multiple drone control in the Drone Engineering Ecosystem</h1>**

The main goal of this project was to develop a desktop application using Python and CustomTkinter which makes possible to fly up to four drones at the same time inside the DroneLab in the EETAC (UPC) campus. This application allows the user to:
  - Display and movement tracking of up to four drones in the main panel.
  - Configuration of the geofence and its parameters for each drone.
  - Return To Launch maneuver for each drone from the main panel.
  - Secondarily it allows to pilot each drone from the app.

**<h1>Demo</h1>**

In order to undersand how to to use this application a demonstration has been done in the following video: LINK.

The demonstration consists of four drones being simulated from the Mission Planner simulator. Through this video you will see all the funcionalities of the application and which order you should follow to run it successfully.
